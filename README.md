# VBA-GET-Requests
Interacting with API's using VBA to improve efficiency in EXCEL

The Quadriga - GET was a proof of concept file to determine if API requests would work in VBA. They do. It pulls live crypto-pricing down from Quadrigacx crypto-exchange.

FX - GET file was a more functional file. This Excel file pulls current and historical information sourced 
from the European Central bank from this amazing and free website http://exchangeratesapi.io/
Now FX data can be more easily incorporated into spreadsheets for reporting and modeling.

Historical-GET file pulls historical crypto information sourced from the cryptocompare API. This sheet has alot of potential to lessen the time spent of those who calculate gains/losses on crypto-trades.
